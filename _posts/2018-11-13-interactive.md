This is a work done as a part of [AI Painting: an Aesthetic Painting Generation System]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/is/aipainting.pdf) (ACMMM'18). I cooperated with the author of this work, added an interactive edit part to the origin work, as well as developed a new UI. The final application can be accessed from both PC and mobile phones, and the following video is demo of the new system on mobile phone.
