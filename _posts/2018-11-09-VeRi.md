Vehicle ReId by deep learning is still a new practice, with only limited data provided, like VeRi-776, VID, and CompCars. Current research bases on these two datasets, now reaching the accuracy of around 90% CMC@1 in VeRi and around 70% CMC@1 in VID. However, in CVPR 2018 workshop, NVIDIA held an AI city challenge containing a track of vehicle retrieval, and the results were really poor, which was approximately 30%. The main reason for low performance is that the dataset is under unrestricted practical scene. The challenge's dataset is several 90 minute long raw video of traffic monitors, as compared to those cropped and cleaned images of vehicles in those dataset.

Possible cause of performance degradation is not simply cross dataset generalization, but also the complicated syndrome emerged with the combination of detection, tracking, matching and enormous problems in practice. In this article I describe my work on vehicle re-id under unrestricted scenrario during internship at MSRA. It's pitiful that I did not make any novel breakthrough in only 3-months internship, but I managed to set up a well-developed framework for unrestricted vehicle re-id, and tried some methods to improve the performance.

My work looks like the follows:
