## About conda

Anaconda is a completely local package manager, any that involves a sudo permission is not normal.

A rare problem: `conda update conda` result in a permission denied error in MacOS somehow. This is because a directory happens to have a high permission to write. Lots of people search for solutions on github and there comes a solution: `sudo chown -R user ~/anaconda2` to change the permission of the directory.

If you encounter any thing about package incorrect or not found, please first try to update conda!
