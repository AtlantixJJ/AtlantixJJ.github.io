## CompCars Dataset

The dataset as a whole is organized as a three-layer tree structure: `make_id/model_id/year/image`. Totally there is over a thousand car types, however they suggest to train the network using only part of the cars, which covers about 400+ car types.

The suggested set is quite smaller thgan original set, for which the reason is not clear. To make it simpler, read the train/test txt file as the split list. The second term serves as model label, though I think there is some empty ids. Okay, who cares?

## VeRi Dataset

The most obvious difference of VeRi datasaet is its label. For ordinary training, we can select any images from a same vehicle or from a different vehicle, or select a track as a whole. All the information you need is labeled.

As for evaluation, there are
