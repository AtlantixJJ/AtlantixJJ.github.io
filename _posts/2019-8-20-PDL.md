## Lession 1 Communication

```
Before class starts, Prof. Garcia stood on the table without speaking a word. He raised three fingers and introduced the three priniciples.
```

- To persue progress, not perfection.

- Be not afraid to failures, it is the feedback.

- Challenge limits.

### Be careful about body language

Show good impression in interview, from standing up to walk to interviewer. Body speaks before mouth opens.

- Shake hand: firm handshake, direct eye contact and simile. To show ethusiasm, trust and respect.

- Avoid behaviors like crossing hands, angry facial expressions, sleep, etc. 

### Make a good speech

- Ethusiasm: universal language.

```
A guy come into professor's office with lots of verbal crutches, but end up with:
It's like ... yeah!
```

- Get rid of verbal crutch. Get somebody to remind you.

```
like, kind of, you know, sort of, so
```

- Slow down, make good use of pause to help you organize, emphasize and help audience catch up.

```
If there is a wrong, (pause) we right it.
If there is a moutain, (pause) we climd it.
```

- Be careful of opening and closing.

### Assignments

- Prepare a resume, and print copy.

- Prepare a professional photo.

- Prepare lionmail signiture.
